<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Make sure to have `Python` installed on your device, then,
to get a local copy up and running follow these steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/theblackcat98/AutoTransferX.git
   ```

2. Open `main.py`, and follow the CLI to create your first folder pair!

    ```sh
    ./main.py
    ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

The specified watch folder is the Downloads folder, and the Documents folder as the destination folder to transfer files to. The user has also specified two different file extensions to watch for - ".pdf" and ".docx".

When a new file with one of these extensions is added to the Downloads folder, AutoTransfer automatically transfers it to the corresponding subfolder in the Documents folder. For example, a new PDF file is transferred to the Documents/PDFs folder, and a new Word document is transferred to the Documents/Word Docs folder. This saves the user time and effort by organizing their files automatically based on their file type.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_ (todo)
